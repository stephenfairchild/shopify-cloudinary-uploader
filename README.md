### Shopify Product Uploader


#### The problem

The Shopify product upload UI is fairly tedious and there are a million options that need selected. It's tricky to provision defaults and it still requires a lot of uneccessary clicks. Additionaly, when Haley makes a piece of art there are several formats and sizes we'll need the piece in, so we need to route the image through a tool to handle resizing for us.

#### The solution
This node script allows uploading to Cloudinary for image hosting, and then takes the image and product details and uploads it into Shopify.

It's not entirely complete yet, but we've been able to upload products through it so far.
